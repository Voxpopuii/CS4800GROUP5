The class below is in charge of login a user into the app after the user click on the login
button from the login GUI. The class first check if the username and password matches the
username and password for the same user in the database. If the username and password don't
match, the class would return and print an error message. On the other hand, the class should be able to take
the user to the home employee GUI(main screen after login-in the app) if the username and password 
entered belongs to an employee user. If the username or password entered belong to a manager, the class
should be able to recognize these credentials and take the user to the home GUI  for a manager user.
In addition, if credential matches our database record, it should print in the console a verification message
